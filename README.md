## Chaotic-pendulum

/2011-11-26/

Matlab code;

Chaotic double pendulum solver. Two massive point-like objects connected by massless rods, acting as a double pendulum. The code simulates the movement of this double pendulum in a dissipative field, where the dissipative force if linearly proportional to the velocity of the mass.

Initial conditions, masses and lengths can be set, the dissipative field can be made to pump energy into the system instead of dissipating it.

Outputs the orbits of the two pendula and positions as a function of time.
